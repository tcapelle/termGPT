# OpenAI Chatbot

This program uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot that can converse with users. The chatbot is powered by the GPT-3.5-turbo language model and can answer a wide range of questions.

## Usage

To run the chatbot, execute the `termgpt/chat.py` file in your terminal:

```
python termgpt/chat.py
```

The chatbot will start running and you can type in your questions. If you want to ask questions based on a specific file, provide the filename as an argument:

```
python termgpt/chat.py filename.txt
```


## Install
```bash
$ pip install 

You can also install this tool and have it available on your terminal:

```bash

$ gpt
